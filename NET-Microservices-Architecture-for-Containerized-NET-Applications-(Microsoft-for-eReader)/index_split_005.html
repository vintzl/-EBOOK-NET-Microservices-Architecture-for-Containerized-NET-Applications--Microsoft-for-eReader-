	<h2 id="id_Toc534713593" class="block_18">Using container-based orchestrators in Microsoft Azure</h2>
	<p class="block_14">Several cloud vendors offer Docker containers support plus Docker clusters and orchestration support, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2 Container Service, and Google Container Engine. Microsoft Azure provides Docker cluster and orchestrator support through Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Service Fabric and Azure Service Fabric Mesh.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc534713594" class="block_18">Using Azure Kubernetes Service</h2>
	<p class="block_14">A Kubernetes cluster pools multiple Docker hosts and exposes them as a single virtual Docker host, so you can deploy multiple containers into the cluster and scale-out with any number of container instances. The cluster will handle all the complex management plumbing, like scalability, health, and so forth.</p>
	<p class="block_14">AKS provides a way to simplify the creation, configuration, and management of a cluster of virtual machines in Azure that are preconfigured to run containerized applications. Using an optimized configuration of popular open-source scheduling and orchestration tools, AKS enables you to use your existing skills or draw on a large and growing body of community expertise to deploy and manage container-based applications on Microsoft Azure.</p>
	<p class="block_14">Azure Kubernetes Service optimizes the configuration of popular Docker clustering open-source tools and technologies specifically for Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability for both your containers and your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and the orchestrator tools, and AKS handles everything else.</p>

	<p class="block_14">If figure 4-24 you can see the structure of a Kubernetes cluster where a master node (VM) controls most of the coordination of the cluster and you can deploy containers to the rest of the nodes which are managed as a single pool from an application point of view and allows you to scale to thousands or even tens of thousands of containers.</p>

	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">To begin using AKS, you deploy an AKS cluster from the Azure portal or by using th CLI. For more information on deploying an Azure Container Service cluster, see </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal" class="text_4">Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14">There are no fees for any of the software installed by default as part of AKS. All default options are implemented with open-source software. AKS is available for multiple virtual machines in Azure. You’re charged only for the compute instances you choose, as well as the other underlying infrastructure resources consumed, such as storage and networking. There are no incremental charges for AKS itself.</p>

	<h2 id="id_Toc534713597" class="block_18">Deploying with Helm charts into Kubernetes clusters</h2>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">When deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the original kubectl.exe CLI tool using deployment files based on the native format (.yaml files), as already mentioned in the previous section. However, for more complex Kubernetes applications such as when deploying complex microservice-based applications, it’s recommended to use </span><a href="https://helm.sh/" class="text_4">Helm</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14">Helm Charts helps you define, version, install, share, upgrade or rollback even the most complex Kubernetes application.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">Going further, Helm usage is also recommended because additional Kubernetes environments in Azure, such as </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dev-spaces/azure-dev-spaces" class="text_4">Azure Dev Spaces</a><span class="text_5"> are also based on Helm charts.</span></p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">Helm is maintained by the </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/" class="text_4">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a><span class="text_5"> - in collaboration with Microsoft, Google, Bitnami and the Helm contributor community.</span></p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">For further implementation information on Helm charts and Kubernetes check the post on </span><a href="https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/wiki/10.1-Deploying-to-AKS-using-Helm-Charts" class="text_4">Using Helm Charts to deploy eShopOnContainers to AKS</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc534713598" class="block_18">Use Azure Dev Spaces for your Kubernetes application lifecycle</h2>
	<p class="block_17"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/dev-spaces/azure-dev-spaces" class="text_4">Azure Dev Spaces</a><span class="text_5"> provides a rapid, iterative Kubernetes development experience for teams. With minimal dev machine setup, you can iteratively run and debug containers directly in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Develop on Windows, Mac, or Linux using familiar tools like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the command line.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14">As mentioned, Azure Dev Spaces uses Helm charts when deploying the container-based applications.</p>
	<p class="block_14">Azure Dev Spaces helps development teams be more productive on Kubernetes because it allows you to rapidly iterate and debug code directly in a global Kubernetes cluster in Azure by simply using Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code. That Kubernetes cluster in Azure is a shared managed Kubernetes cluster, so your team can collaboratively work together. You can develop your code in isolation, then deploy to the global cluster and do end-to-end testing with other components without replicating or mocking up dependencies.</p>
	<p class="block_14">As shown in figure 4-26, the most differential feature in Azure Dev Spaces is capability of creating ‘spaces’ that can run integrated to the rest of the global deployment in the cluster.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-31.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image38.png" class="calibre42"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-26</span><i class="calibre8">. Using multiple spaces in Azure Dev Spaces</i></p>
	<p class="block_14">Basically you can set up a shared dev space in Azure. Each developer can focus on just their part of the application, and can iteratively develop pre-commit code in a dev space that already contains all the other services and cloud resources that their scenarios depend on. Dependencies are always up-to-date, and developers are working in a way that mirrors production.</p>
	<p class="block_14">Azure Dev Spaces provides the concept of a space, which allows you to work in isolation, and without the fear of breaking your team members. This feature is based on URL pre-fixes, so if using any dev space prefix in the URL, for every container’s request, it will run a special version of the container is deployed for that space it it exists. Otherwise, it will run the global/consolidated version.</p>

	<h1 id="id_Toc534713600" class="block_24">Using Azure Service Fabric</h1>
	<p class="block_14">Azure Service Fabric arose from Microsoft’s transition from delivering box products, which were typically monolithic in style, to delivering services. The experience of building and operating large services at scale, such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, or Cortana’s back end, shaped Service Fabric. The platform evolved over time as more and more services adopted it. Importantly, Service Fabric had to run not only in Azure but also in standalone Windows Server deployments.</p>
	<p class="block_14">The aim of Service Fabric is to solve the hard problems of building and running a service and utilizing infrastructure resources efficiently, so that teams can solve business problems using a microservices approach.</p>
	<p class="block_14">Service Fabric provides two broad areas to help you build applications that use a microservices approach:</p>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_25">A platform that provides system services to deploy, scale, upgrade, detect, and restart failed services, discover service location, manage state, and monitor health. These system services in effect enable many of the characteristics of microservices described previously.</li>
	<li class="block_20"><span class="text_">Programming APIs or frameworks to help you build applications as microservices: </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-choose-framework" class="text_1">reliable actors and reliable services</a><span class="text_">. You can choose any code to build your microservice, but these APIs make the job more straightforward, and they integrate with the platform at a deeper level. This way you can get health and diagnostics information, or you can take advantage of reliable state management.</span></li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_14">Service Fabric is agnostic with respect to how you build your service, and you can use any technology. However, it provides built-in programming APIs that make it easier to build microservices.</p>
	<p class="block_14">As shown in Figure 4-27, you can create and run microservices in Service Fabric either as simple processes or as Docker containers. It’s also possible to mix container-based microservices with process-based microservices within the same Service Fabric cluster.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-32.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image30.png" class="calibre43"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-27</span><i class="calibre8">. Deploying microservices as processes or as containers in Azure Service Fabric</i></p>
	<p class="block_14">Service Fabric clusters based on Linux and Windows hosts can run Docker Linux containers and Windows Containers, respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">For up-to-date information about containers support in Azure Service Fabric, see </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview" class="text_4">Service Fabric and containers</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">Service Fabric is a good example of a platform where you can define a different logical architecture (business microservices or Bounded Contexts) than the physical implementation that were introduced in the </span><a href="index_split_004.html#id_Toc534713547" class="text_4">Logical architecture versus physical architecture</a><span class="text_5"> section. For example, if you implement </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction" class="text_4">Stateful Reliable Services</a><span class="text_5">, which are introduced in the section </span><a href="#id_Toc534713602" class="text_4">Stateless versus stateful microservices</a><span class="text_5"> later, you can have a business microservice concept with multiple physical services.</span></p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">As shown in Figure 4-28, and thinking from a logical/business microservice perspective, when implementing a Service Fabric Stateful Reliable Service, you usually will need to implement two tiers of services. The first is the back-end stateful reliable service, which handles multiple partitions (each partition is a stateful service). The second is the front-end service, or Gateway service, in charge of routing and data aggregation across multiple partitions or stateful service instances. That Gateway service also handles client-side communication with retry loops accessing the back-end service. It’s called a Gateway service if you implement your custom service, or alternatively you can also use the out-of-the-box Service Fabric </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reverseproxy" class="text_4">reverse proxy</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-33.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image31.png" class="calibre44"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-28</span><i class="calibre8">. Business microservice with several stateful service instances and a custom gateway front-end</i></p>
	<p class="block_14">In any case, when you use Service Fabric Stateful Reliable Services, you also have a logical or business microservice (Bounded Context) that’s usually composed of multiple physical services. Each of them, the Gateway service and Partition service could be implemented as ASP.NET Web API services, as shown in Figure 4-28.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">In Service Fabric, you can group and deploy groups of services as a </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-application-model" class="text_4">Service Fabric Application</a><span class="text_5">, which is the unit of packaging and deployment for the orchestrator or cluster. Therefore, the Service Fabric Application could be mapped to this autonomous business and logical microservice boundary or Bounded Context, as well, so you could deploy these services autonomously.</span></p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc534713601" class="block_18">Service Fabric and containers</h2>
	<p class="block_14">With regard to containers in Service Fabric, you can also deploy services in container images within a Service Fabric cluster. As Figure 4-29 shows, most of the time there will only be one container per service.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-34.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image32.png" class="calibre45"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-29</span><i class="calibre8">. Business microservice with several services (containers) in Service Fabric</i></p>
	<p class="block_14">However, so-called “sidecar” containers (two containers that must be deployed together as part of a logical service) are also possible in Service Fabric. The important thing is that a business microservice is the logical boundary around several cohesive elements. In many cases, it might be a single service with a single data model, but in some other cases you might have several physical services as well.</p>
	<p class="block_14">Note that you can mix services in processes and services in containers in the same Service Fabric application, as shown in Figure 4-30.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-35.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image33.png" class="calibre46"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-30</span><i class="calibre8">. Business microservice mapped to a Service Fabric application with containers and stateful services</i></p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">For more information about container support in Azure Service Fabric, see </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview" class="text_4">Service Fabric and containers</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc534713602" class="block_18">Stateless versus stateful microservices</h2>
	<p class="block_14">As mentioned earlier, each microservice (logical Bounded Context) must own its domain model (data and logic). In the case of stateless microservices, the databases will be external, employing relational options like SQL Server, or NoSQL options like Azure Cosmos DB or MongoDB.</p>
	<p class="block_14">But the services themselves can also be stateful in Service Fabric, which means that the data resides within the microservice. This data might exist not just on the same server, but within the microservice process, in memory and persisted on hard drives and replicated to other nodes. Figure 4-30 shows the different approaches.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-36.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image34.png" class="calibre47"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-31</span><i class="calibre8">. Stateless versus stateful microservices</i></p>
	<p class="block_14">A stateless approach is perfectly valid and is easier to implement than stateful microservices, since the approach is similar to traditional and well-known patterns. But stateless microservices impose latency between the process and data sources. They also involve more moving pieces when you’re trying to improve performance with additional cache and queues. The result is that you can end up with complex architectures that have too many tiers.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">In contrast, </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction" class="text_4">stateful microservices</a><span class="text_5"> can excel in advanced scenarios, because there’s no latency between the domain logic and data. Heavy data processing, gaming back ends, databases as a service, and other low-latency scenarios all benefit from stateful services, which enable local state for faster access.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14">Stateless and stateful services are complementary. For instance, you can see in Figure 4-31, in the right diagram, that a stateful service could be split into multiple partitions. To access those partitions, you might need a stateless service acting as a gateway service that knows how to address each partition based on partition keys.</p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">Stateful services do have drawbacks. They impose a level of complexity that allows to scale out. Functionality that would usually be implemented by external database systems must be addressed for tasks such as data replication across stateful microservices and data partitioning. However, this is one of the areas where an orchestrator like </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-platform-architecture" class="text_4">Azure Service Fabric</a><span class="text_5"> with its </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction" class="text_4">stateful reliable services</a><span class="text_5"> can help the most—by simplifying the development and lifecycle of stateful microservices using the </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-work-with-reliable-collections" class="text_4">Reliable Services API</a><span class="text_5"> and </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction" class="text_4">Reliable Actors</a><span class="text_5">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_17"><span class="text_5">Other microservice frameworks that allow stateful services, that support the Actor pattern, and that improve fault tolerance and latency between business logic and data are Microsoft </span><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans" class="text_4">Orleans</a><span class="text_5">, from Microsoft Research, and </span><a href="https://getakka.net/" class="text_4">Akka.NET</a><span class="text_5">. Both frameworks are currently improving their support for Docker.</span></p>
	<p class="block_14">Note that Docker containers are themselves stateless. If you want to implement a stateful service, you need one of the additional prescriptive and higher-level frameworks noted earlier.</p>
	<h2 id="id_Toc534713603" class="block_18">Using Azure Service Fabric Mesh</h2>
	<p class="block_14">Azure Service Fabric Mesh is a fully managed service which enables developers to build and deploy mission critical applications without managing any infrastructure. Use Service Fabric Mesh to build and run secure, distributed microservices applications that scale on demand.</p>
	<p class="block_14">As shown in figure 4-32, applications hosted on Service Fabric Mesh run and scale without you worrying about the infrastructure powering it.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><img src="images/image-37.png" alt="C:\Users\Miguel\source\repos\dotnet\docs\docs\standard\microservices-architecture\architect-microservice-container-applications\media\image39.png" class="calibre48"/></p>
	<p class="block_23"><span class="text_6">Figure 4-32</span><i class="calibre8">. Deploying a microservice/containers application to Service Fabric Mesh</i></p>
	<p class="block_14">Under the covers, Service Fabric Mesh consists of clusters of thousands of machines. All cluster operations are hidden from the developer. You simply need to upload your containers and specify resources you need, availability requirements, and resource limits. Service Fabric Mesh automatically allocates the infrastructure requested by your application deployment and also handles infrastructure failures, making sure your applications are highly available. You only need to care about the health and responsiveness of your application, not the infrastructure.</p>
